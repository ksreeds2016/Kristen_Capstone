### The Project 

This will be an analysis of accidents involving motor vehicles with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Carrier Administration. The final presentation will involve various charts showing which vehicle had the highest, and the lowest accidents over a 3-year span. Which states is ranked worst, and which has the least accidents. There will also be a few other charts involving age groups, time of day, and which months has the highest accident count.

### Just Keep on Trucking

Working in the trucking industry, I've learned the ins and outs of what requirements must be met for a driver to be eligible to operate a Class A/Class B vehicle. I've spent countless hours working through 150+ files a week, which involves accident reporting, employment history, drug, and alcohol history etc. I went into this field with no knowledge, and now I want to show in my final project how often accidents happen with these types of motor vehicles. What also helped motivate my direction for this project is living right next to a major interstate. It’s currently under construction to add lanes to make it safer for the influx of traffic, but it’s become more of a hazard for accidents. In the last month, there’s been multiple accidents involving tractor trailers in a 2-mile span.

### Data Questions

•	Which type of motor vehicle with the FMSCA has the most accidents? Which has the least? And has there been an increase in accidents over the last 3 years?

•	Is there a higher rate of accidents that occur during certain months where travel is likely to be higher? (Ex. Spring break, summer, etc.) 

•	Which state is ranked as the worst for accidents? And has there been an increase/and or decrease in those 3 years.

### Process, problems, and the technologies

#### More processes, More problems

The data used I was able to obtain in CSV format, and able to clean up most of it through excel. It was then moved into python for further exploration, cleaning, and aggregation. Once I pulled the information I needed, I converted what was pulled into separate CSVs to be used for the final dashboards. A few issues I’ve come across is how overwhelmingly large the data was, and when trying to make charts, it skewed the charts to the point they weren’t usable. I had to go back into another process of cleaning and converting the data to format properly for the charts I needed for the analysis.

Another issue that I hopefully will be able to rectify in the future is that the data for 2022 only goes to November. December’s data has not be made available yet, and the totals should expect at least a 15k-20k increase once I’m able to obtain that month. 

#### Technology Used

- Excel - for cleaning
- Python - for cleaning, aggregation, and exploration of the data
- PowerPoint - intro to capstone
- Tableau - Final Dashboard cleaning, aggregation, and exploration of the data

### Conclusion

Tractor/Semi Trailers have the highest total in accidents each year, and passenger cars coming in at the lowest. With COVID-19 happening in 2020, the accident totals that year were lower, but after the initial wave, it continues to increase throughout the year. In the full analysis, 2021 was the worse year for accidents, having a 20k increase from the previous year. Due to the restrictions being lifted, people were no longer limited to their households, and that likely caused an increase in road travel, which also comes with the increase risk for accidents. Looking at accidents per month, I don’t think the months where travel is likely to be higher (ex. Spring break, summer, holiday travels) has any big factor into accidents. After 2020, accident totals stayed consistent with an increase/decrease of maybe 1k to 2k per month, but nothing that stuck out to say that accidents totals will be higher this month because of so and so holiday. Texas ranked #1 for being the worst for accidents, with Alaska coming in with the least amount of accidents each year.
