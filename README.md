### Summary of the Project

I want to be able to do a compare and contrast over accidents involving vehicles (the ones that require certain licenses to driver) with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. I plan to pull data from the last 3 years (2020-2022) to show how accidents have possibly increased/and or decreased over the last few years, and which states have the most amount of wrecks. I also want to show which months have the higest rate of accidents occuring, espcially where traveling is more prominent like Spring Break, Summer, or Holiday travels. 


### Motivation

I’ve worked in the transportation industry for the last six years, and I went into this field with absolutely no knowledge of how that industry worked. Over those 6 years, I learned the ins and outs of what companies are required to comply with, qualifications both the drivers and the companies must meet that have been implemented by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. I've spent countless hours working with mutiple departments, and the drivers themselves to gain insight on why an accident occured, what happened, what kind of accident, etc. One thing you do learn is how easy it is for a motor vehicle of that nature to be involved in an accident, whether it's something minor, and or major. That's why I want to show an analysis of how many accidents have occured over the last 3 years, and what states seem to have the highest rate of accidents.  


### Data Questions

•	Which type of motor vehicle with the FMSCA has the most accidents? Which has the least? And has there been an increase in accidents over the last 3 years?

•	Is there a higher rate of accidents that occur during certain months where travel is likely to be higher? (Ex. Spring break, summer, etc.)

•	Which state is ranked as the worst for accidents? And has there been an increase/and or decrease in those 3 years.  


### Process, problems, and the technologies 

I was luckily able to obtain my data in CSV form directly from the FMCSA websites, but it didn't come without it's problems. Once I obtained the files I needed, I cleaned them up in Excel to remove items that skewed the data from uploading correctly into Python. Once I moved into Python, I was able to explore my data furthur, clean, and aggreagate my data. Another issue I ran into is I didn't take into consideration how overwhelmingly large my dataset was, and when trying to make certain charts, it would be illegible, which makes in unusable for my final dashboard. I had to break down, and change around certain columns to make them function properly when trying to convert them into a usable charts.
