### Summary of the Project

My project consists an analysis of comparing and contrasting accidents involving vehicles with the federal motor carrier safety administration. Which involves class a & class b vehicles. My final dashboard will consist of various charts providing insight on which vehicle has the highest, and the lowest amount of accidents. If there's certain months where crashes are highers, and a certain time. 


### Motivation

I’ve spent the last 6 years working in the transportation industry, and I came into this field with absolutely no knowledge of it. Over these 6 years, I learned the ins and outs of what requirements are needed to hire a driver. The certain qualifications they must meet by both the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the company they are applying to work at. Which means I have spent countless hours reviewing applications, which include accidents. The one thing I’ve learned is how easy it is for these types of vehicles to be involved in an accident, whether it’s minor, or a major accident. This lead me down to choosing this topic for my project because I want to show how often accidents with these vehicles occur. 

### Data Questions

•	Which type of motor vehicle with the FMSCA has the most accidents? Which has the least? And has there been an increase in accidents over the last 3 years?

•	Is there a higher rate of accidents that occur during certain months where travel is likely to be higher? (Ex. Spring break, summer, etc.) 

•	Which state is ranked as the worst for accidents? And has there been an increase/and or decrease in those 3 years.  



### Process, problems, and the technologies 

I was luckily able to obtain my data in CSV form directly from the FMCSA websites, but it didn't come without it's problems. Once I obtained the files I needed, I cleaned them up in Excel to remove items that skewed the data from uploading correctly into Python. Once I moved into Python, I was able to explore my data furthur, clean, and aggreagate my data. Another issue I ran into is I didn't take into consideration how overwhelmingly large my dataset was, and when trying to make certain charts, it would be illegible, which makes in unusable for my final dashboard. I had to break down, and change around certain columns to make them function properly when trying to convert them into a usable charts.
